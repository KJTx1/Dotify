# Background Tasks & Notifications by Jason Yan

The Annoying Ex app will ping notifications with messages such as “hey you up?, “wyd”, “I miss you”, “can we talk”, “i still love you”, “plz unblock me”, “Netflix n chill?” for every 20 minutes or so regardless of whether the app is on or off. At the same time, User has the option to block them with a “block” button.

For the extra credit, I accomplished both of them (1 & 2).
