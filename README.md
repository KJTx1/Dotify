# Application, JSON parsing & Network Requests by Jason Yan

Rebuild Dotify music app with Fragments and Application Object. Manage Volley HTTP request and list of songs through Application level managers, and parse JSON data using GSON from songList API as well as use Picasso to load pictures.

(PS: After booting up the Dotify app, it will show the user an alert window to quit the app if the request fails due to the internet disconnection. What's more, the loading of pictures can be affected by the Internet connectivity and speed)
